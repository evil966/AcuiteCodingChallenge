This project is a very simple MVC application that loads a list of Books from a fake database and displays them
on screen. Feel free to run the application to see what is already complete.


Part 1: Complete the functionality required to filter books by category

- The 'Filter By' dropdown should modify the main list of books to only show those in the selected category
- The page must not be reloaded when filtering the list

Part 2: Implement a search function

- Add something to the page to allow users to search for books by author name and book title
- It should allow users to type in a search term
- The page must not be reloaded when applying the search


Feel free to use any frameworks/libraries/techniques that you like


Part 3: Improve the code

The code works, but there are a few areas that could do with some improvement. Maybe there are some bugs,
or things missing that would make it a more complete and high quality solution. Think about concepts like code
readability/maintainability/consistency, the SOLID design principles, MVC best practices, unit testing, even
think if anything could be improved from a UI / UX standpoint.

Try and imagine that this is just part of a much larger book-related application, with multiple developers working
on the system at once.

There is no single right answer here, we just want to see what you would consider to be top-quality code.



Important:

- Do not modify the contents of the Database.cs file. This file simply mimics a data store and is not part of the challenge.
- You are welcome to use/extend the code/classes in Database.cs in different ways, however, should you wish to.
